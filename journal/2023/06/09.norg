Children are not toys. I cannot venture forth not knowing we can co-operate on self-evident truths. Children are not a
magic wand to wish our problems away, they require care, intense planning as we have been told, patience, time
engagement, a lot of money, and I cannot shoulder this whilst also fighting for simple things that in my opinion should be already
agreed upon.
